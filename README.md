# Loop-Tunes

"<em>Draw your own kind of music.<br/>Paint your own special song!</em>"

Loop-tunes is a chip-tune music creation sandbox game. It works by compositing multiple wave forms on top of each other.
It was created during [bevy-jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5) with the theme *cycles*.

This is my first real bevy project and to avoid complicated things like UI, it has no UI. Please check the controls below.

The procedural audio is played through a [custom audio backend](src/looptunes.rs) written during the jam using crossbeam-channel and rodio.
Copy & paste functionality is provided by a [clipboard plugin](src/clipboard.rs) that I also wrote during the jam.

### How to start
- Click on the 2m8s circle.
- Keep the mouse above it.
- Press *shift + space* to start playing.
- Press that again to make it stop.
- Press *shift + delete* to remove it all. 
- Check the controls below on how to draw your own music.

### How to share
- Hover above your song's root node and press *ctrl + C* to copy your creation.
- Share it in the comments below.
- Other people can copy that and paste it into the game with *ctrl + V*.
