Loop-tunes is a chip-tune music creation sandbox game. It works by compositing multiple wave forms on top of each other.
It was created during [bevy-jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5) with the theme *cycles*.

This is my first real bevy project and to avoid complicated things like UI, it has no UI. Please check the controls below.

The procedural audio is played through a [tiny custom backend](src/looptunes.rs) written during the jam using crossbeam-channel and rodio.

## Available on:

- [itch.io](https://bcmpinc.itch.io/loop-tunes)
- [github](https://github.com/bcmpinc/looptunes)

## Controls:

**Playback:**
- Activate circles using *spacebar* to listen to them.
- Activate entire trees of circles using *shift + spacebar*.

**Navigation:**

- Zoom using the scroll wheel.

**Circle manipulation:**
