"<em>Draw your own kind of music.<br/>Paint your own special song!</em>"

Loop-tunes is a chip-tune music creation sandbox game. It works by compositing multiple wave forms on top of each other.
It was created during [bevy-jam 5](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-5) with the theme *cycles*.

This is my first real bevy project and to avoid complicated things like UI, it has no UI. Please check the controls below.

### How to start
- Click on the 2m8s circle.
- Keep the mouse above it.
- Press *shift + space* to start playing.
- Press that again to make it stop.
- Press *shift + delete* to remove it all. 
- Check the controls below on how to draw your own music.

### How to share
- Hover above your song's root node and press *ctrl + C* to copy your creation.
- Share it in the comments below.
- Other people can copy that and paste it into the game with *ctrl + V*. 

### Available on:
- [itch.io](https://bcmpinc.itch.io/loop-tunes)
- [github](https://github.com/bcmpinc/looptunes)

## Controls:

**Playback:**
- Activate circles using *spacebar* to listen to them.
- Activate entire trees of circles using *shift + spacebar*.

**Navigation:**
- Drag the screen with the *right mouse button*.
- Zoom using the scroll wheel.

**Circle manipulation:**
- Drag circles with the *left mouse button*.
- Draw on circles with the *left mouse button* while zoomed in.
- Change the frequency of circles with *shift + scroll wheel*.

**Circle creation/removal:**

- Clone circles by holding *ctrl* while dragging them. Hold *shift* to include child nodes.
- Delete circles using the *delete* key. Hold *shift* to include child nodes. 
- Copy a node and all its children with *ctrl + C* and paste with *ctrl + V*.
- You can save a copied tree by pasting it into a text file.

**Connectivity**
- Add/change connection by holding *shift* and dragging from one circle to another.
- While dragging a new connection, hold *shift* for angle snapping, or release *shift* for free positioning.

## Credits
The very few assets this game has, have been made by me during the jam.

ChatGPT has been invaluable for teaching me how to write code for bevy and where to look in the documentation.
Without it, I would not have been able to write things like:

- the [custom audio backend](src/looptunes.rs) for playing procedrual music; and
- the [clipboard plugin](src/clipboard.rs) for saving and loading creations.


### Used libraries:
- bevy v0.14 (obviously)
- bevy_embedded_assets
- rodio & crossbeam-channel (for audio playback)
- copypasta, web-sys (for clipboard access)
- serde, bitcode, zstd & base64 (for copy & paste functionality)
- rand, smallvec
